# Python_for_Everybody_Specialization

This repository are my submissions for the University of Michigan 5 course specialization, **‘Python for Everybody’** available on Coursera.

The course is/was available at: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python

Not every week required a submission, so some folders are blank.
